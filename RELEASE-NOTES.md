## Meza 31.5.0

Major deploy and autodeploy improvements; Push backups to remote server; Security and general improvements; bug fixes

### Commits since 31.4.0

#### Autodeploy on changes to secret config and use Ansible for autodeployer

Autodeployer has previously just tracked public config and the Meza application. Now it will check secret config, too. Additionally, autodeployer was rewritten in Ansible. Shell scripting got too cumbersome.

* 195cbea Fixes for autodeployer logic and misplaced variables
* 64896a5 Replace autodeployer scripts with Ansible
* 4dfb030 Belt and suspenders for ensuring deploy unlocks
* 006d5ed Reduce duplication in check-for-changes.sh
* 901f2b9 Make public config and Meza management by autodeployer optional
* 1dc9894 Use secret_config_repo to define secret config
* bce32d3 Autodeployer check for changes to secret config

#### Prevent simultaneous deploys and improve logging

Starting a deploy now creates a lock file. Other deploys cannot start until the locking deploy is complete. Additionally, all deploys automatically write to a log file and print to stdout. In the future this will be used to display deploy logs via the web interface.

* 60a680c Add wait() to capture return code
* e7b8ad3 Make sure deploy log directory exists
* 5009974 Always have ansible show colors
* a120ac3 Make meza_shell_exec use subprocess; optionally write to log file
* c5ef0e5 Add meza deploy-kill, deploy-log, deploy-tail functions
* 9438f7c Handle sigint; also better info in lock file
* a8f1aca Add 'meza deploy-(un)lock commands; Autodeployer use them to avoid conflicts
* dd60b91 Add meza subcommand to check if deploy underway
* 04e8ddb Prevent simultaneous deploys (#1157)

#### Make autodeployer configurable

In Meza 31.x prior to this release autodeployer, overwrite-deploys, and backups-cleanup had to be configured manually via crontab. 32.x has had the ability to configure these things in public/secret config for a while. This release pulls that functionality into 31.x.

* 220df48 Add autodeployer tag
* 87a4012 Make autodeployer, overwrite-deploy, and backups-cleanup configurable
* a5396d8 Fix location of backups-cleanup cron
* 28df042 Fix autodeployer crons

#### Push backups to an alternate server

Required if for security reasons dev/int servers cannot SSH into production to grab backups. Instead production can push backups directly to other servers. This was essentially possible before by making the other servers in the `backup-servers` group, but that (a) made it so production managed software configuration on the remote servers (as Meza does for all its server groups) and (b) it put file uploads in the `/opt/data-meza/backups` directory rather than in `/opt/data-meza/uploads`. So you'd have to do some symlink or have duplicated data. With pushed backups the production server (or whatever server is pushing) just needs to be setup so user `meza-ansible` can SSH into the server with a lesser-privileged account. The user must be in group `apache` and `meza-backups`.

* 6e54a86 Enable rsync push backups (#1166)
* 2784f81 Add option to recursively set perms on uploads dir; always run on overwrite

#### Security improvements

Steadily trying to reduce where `root` is required

* 36104ea Have meza-ansible do autodeployer git-fetch
* 2513a36 Set ownership of meza and config; fix role:init-controller-config

#### General improvements

* Vagrant improvements
  * bddb797 Unique VM names, /opt/meza owned by UID/GID 10000 in Vagrant
  * Unique VM names allows you to boot multiple Meza's on one host
  * UID/GID hack required to support using less `root`. Ref #1155
* Add `pip` and `pip3`
  * 3db517a Add pip for Python 2.7
  * 0155726 Add pip3 (31.x didn't have it yet)
  * 0f879f8 Make pip3 symlink for RHEL

#### Fix issues with creating Docker images for testing

Rebuilding Docker images for testing is not required often. It really only needs to be done when major changes are made or when a very long time has passed between generating images and new images will make test jobs run faster. Since a long time had passed, certain things had been added to Meza that unexpectedly caused issues with Docker builds.

* 36f965f Reorder AND statement since initial_wikis_dir_check undefined in docker build
* e919123 Don't use services during docker image building
* 0795348 More docker skip tasks

#### Bug fixes

* 46f7ac6 Make net adapter select statement break on newlines
* 40e4388 Don't recreate meza-ansible if user already exists (Revert #965)
* a621460 Remove yum:PackageKit to remove error
* 0502a41 Ansible 2.8 fixes (#1162) (`ansible_distribution_version` no longer present and `synchronize` module keeps getting harder to use)
* 6789e7d Ansible Git module fails with /tmp mounted with noexec; set TMPDIR as workaround
* 3854c6c Make sure to use TMPDIR when doing Ansible Git operations
